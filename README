This repository contains a neuroConstruct (http://www.neuroConstruct.org) project containing a model of CElegans.

The NeuroML files are available under the directories CElegans/generatedMorphML, CElegans/generatedNeuroML, and CElegans/generatedNeuroML2

This is being developed as part of the OpenWorm project (http://www.openworm.org).

The C. elegans 3D model this was derived from was produced by Dr. Christian Grove and Dr. Paul Sternberg at the VirtualWorm project (WormBase, CalTech) and released into the public domain. You can visit the VirtualWorm home page at http://caltech.wormbase.org/virtualworm/
